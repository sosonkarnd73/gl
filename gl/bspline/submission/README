bspline_param_length.c :
	This program takes input to create bspline curve and find ratio of segment length between u1 and u2 which are also taken as input.
	u1  and u2 are knot values which range between [0,1]
	the random input for this program is created using create_input.c program.

	to calculate the length of segment I calculated points A, B on curve corresponding to u1 and u2 resp.
	then find closest points from this two points A, B from plotted points and note the distance as md1, md2 resp.
	then using this details iterate over all plotted points and accumulate the lengths for segment and curve
	and take ratio.
	input to this program is given using following files
	      output
	      output1
	      shape
create_input.c :
        input parameters are curve_type number of control_points and degree of curve.
	this will generate output in desired format for bspline)param_length.c
	control points are random numbers
	knot vector values depend on the type of curve.
        input to this program is given using
	      input1
