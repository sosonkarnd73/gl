This file contains details of work done
1. recursive_bspline.c
	This file comtains the implementation of B Spline Curves over opengl in c. using Cox De Bhoor recursive algorithm.
	The input to this program is the type of curve
	Its parameters : knot_vector, number_of_knots, control_points, number of control_points

2. create_input.c
	This file is used to create the inpuf for recursive_bspline.c to generate a random bspline curve
	input to this file will be number of control points and degree of bspline curve to be generated.

3. work01.c and work02.c are two implementations of bspline curves with animating curves.
 input files generated and used with above programs : 
     wave_open wave_clamped output_closed hexagon_open hexagon clamped
